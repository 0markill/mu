# Examples
These examples are not intended to be run directly.  Rather, they serve as a reference that can be consulted when creating your own `mu.yml` files.

For detailed steps to create your own project, check out the [quickstart](https://github.com/stelligent/mu/wiki/Quickstart#steps).

NOTE: This feature describes providing a set of environment variables to a service,
which is a completely different feature than described in `./examples/mu-yml-env-variables`.  

Be aware that both features can complement each other, to pass local environment variables to the running services.
See this example's `MU_LAUNCHED_BY` variable.
