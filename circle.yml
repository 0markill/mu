## Don't build when new release tags are pushed
general:
  branches:
    ignore:
      - /^v[0-9]/

## Run 'make deps' for resolving dependencies
dependencies:
  override:
    - make deps

## Run 'make' for compile
compile:
  override:
    - make

## Run 'make test' to test
test:
  override:
    - make test


## In order for deploy to work, you need an environment variable set in CircleCI named "GITHUB_TOKEN" that contains
##  a token created from https://github.com/settings/tokens
##
## Also, an read/write SSH key needs to be created and private key added to circle ci
##    as per https://circleci.com/docs/adding-read-write-deployment-key/
##
## Suggest creating a machine user for the token and ssh key to limit access
##
deployment:
  ## Create 'pre-release' from 'develop' branch
  pre-release:
    branch: develop
    commands:
      - make dev-release

  ## Create 'release' from 'master' branch
  release:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - make release
