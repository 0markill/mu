      ## In order for deploy to work, you need an environment variable set in CircleCI named "GITHUB_TOKEN" that contains
      ##  a token created from https://github.com/settings/tokens
      ##
      ## Also, an read/write SSH key needs to be created and private key added to circle ci
      ##    as per https://circleci.com/docs/adding-read-write-deployment-key/
      ##
      ## Suggest creating a machine user for the token and ssh key to limit access
